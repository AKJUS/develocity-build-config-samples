# Gradle Enterprise build configuration samples

<img src="http://bit.ly/2JSSCT0" align="right" width="280" />

This repository contains code samples that demonstrate how to customize your Gradle Enterprise build configuration using Gradle or Maven.

The samples aim to demonstrate customizations, API usages, and patterns for reusing Gradle Enterprise build configuration across multiple projects. While we do invest in keeping the code current and working, none of the code in this repository has gone through the same rigorous, continuous, and automated testing as our commercial components of Gradle Enterprise.

## Samples

The samples can be roughly grouped into the following categories:
 
 - Data capturing bundles that can be applied on multiple projects
 - Data capturing scripts that demonstrate how to gather specific data
 - Build tool customization scripts optimized for Gradle Enterprise

Every sample contains some explanatory information on its purpose and how to make use of it.
